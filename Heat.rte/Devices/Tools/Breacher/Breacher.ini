	Description = Molten copper-plasma mixture door-busting tool. When activated, this tool will internally prepare a strong, short-lived and volatile blast that will punch clean through anything you point it at. Afterwards, it will set off several frontal flashbangs. Then, you'll want to drop it before it melts in your hands.
